# Dotfiles

## About

Package contains my personal development setup for unix systems.
It contains following options:

* Custom bash aliases
* gitignore rules
* ruby gems config
* personal git config
* personal bash_aliases

## Creating vim snippet

At the moment I'm using coc-snippets as a snippets engine.
If you want to create / update custom snippets run in vim / nvim:

```
:CocCommand snippets.editSnippets
```
